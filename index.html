      <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
      <p>
        Ever since I was young, cars have always captured my imagination. For me, a car
        is more than a machine—it’s a personality, an emotion, and sometimes even a memory.
        The cars you see on this website aren’t just random picks—they’re the ones that
        truly connected with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these cars impressed me with their stunning design, some with their
        engineering and performance, and others simply made me feel something special
        the first time I saw them. This website is my personal space to showcase the
        models that continue to inspire my passion for automobiles.
